# Book-Finder

## Description
This application allows users to search for books by their titles and then create a list of books by saving or removing them from their collection as they go along. It uses the Google Search API to help users in their searches and allows them to find more books and answers than they would have previously thought. The ability to find books that users have been looking for and then remove them from their list once they have read them should help users keep track of the books they have read as well as allow for a list of books they wish to still read.
